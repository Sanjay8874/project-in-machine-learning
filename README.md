## Introduction
We are going to work with the well-known supervised machine learning algorithm called k-NN or k-Nearest Neighbors. For this exercise, we will use the Iris data set for classification. The attribute Species of the data set will be the variable that we want to predict.

## Loading data
First we need to load some libraries.

# Load libraries
1.library(knitr)
2.library(class)


## Summary
In this kernel we have learned about the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, including the data preparation before we execute it (data normalization and division in two parts) and the evaluation of the results.
